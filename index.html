We will be running a new evaluation lab named ChEMU, part of the <a href="https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/">11th Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF-2020)</a>. 
ChEMU proposes two key information extraction tasks over chemical reactions from patents.
<ul>
  <li><b>Task 1: Named Entity Recognition</b> involves identifying chemical compounds as well as their types in context, i.e., to assign the label of a chemical compound according to the role which the compound plays within a chemical reaction.</li>
  <li><b>Task 2: Event extraction over chemical reactions</b> involves event trigger detection and argument recognition.</li>
</ul>

    More details coming soon!
